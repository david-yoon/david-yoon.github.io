I am a Research Scientist at Adobe Research. My research interests are in the areas of <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>natural language processing (NLP)</strong>. I am particularly interested in understanding long texts for question answering systems and learning language representation for NLP tasks. Further interests lie in applying and integrating NLP research with other disciplines to tackle practical issues; understanding multimodal information (i.e., text, audio, and visual) and NLP for social good.
    
    
<p> I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University in 2020 with the Distinguished Dissertation Award, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://milab.snu.ac.kr/kjung/index.html" title="Kyomin Jung">Dr. Kyomin Jung</a>.    
Prior to Seoul National University, I had involved critical initiatives for the engineering and innovation of AI and machine learning while I was a staff software engineer at Samsung Research Artificial Intelligence Center (2006-2017).

<p>I have published studies at NLP, AI, or signal processing conferences, such as <strong>ACL</strong>, <strong>NAACL</strong>, <strong>AAAI</strong>, <strong>CIKM</strong>, and <strong>ICASSP</strong>.
